This coding competition is organized by **CODEZONE** & **/bline.**

We started this coding Competition to develop our junior intake's Problem Solving Knowledge and to test their limits and stress handling when hard times come.

This repo contains a collection of solutions for the past bleedcode competitions in C++, Java and Python.
